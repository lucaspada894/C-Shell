# C-Shell
Simple Linux C shell with history, redirection, and pipeline features. 

There is only one source file. The functions in this file are there to check for pipelines, redirections, history features, etc. and act accordingly. Note: The history fuction does not fully work sometimes when called right after a redirection or pipeline command! This is simple shell and complex commands such as pipelines followed by redirections and then by more pipelines are not supported. History needs a little fixing but 21 credits is killing me...

I have named my functions clearly enough for anyone to understand what they do. 
Anyways, have a nice day!
